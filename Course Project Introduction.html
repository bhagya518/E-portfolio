    <section class="project-overview">
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>The aim of this project is to enhance <strong>E-Commerce Logistics</strong> and <strong>Customer Experience</strong> in the context of a <strong>Smart City</strong>. By leveraging advanced algorithms, we aim to optimize several aspects of the e-commerce ecosystem, improving efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall business performance.</p>

    <section class="problem-space-approach">
        <h2>Problem Space and Approach</h2>
        <p>The problem space revolves around the challenges faced by e-commerce platforms in a smart city environment. These challenges include optimizing logistics, providing dynamic pricing, improving inventory management, ensuring security through fraud detection, and enhancing customer experience through segmentation and personalized services.</p>
        <p>Our approach involves identifying several business cases within the e-commerce domain and applying various algorithms to solve these problems efficiently. These algorithms help streamline operations, reduce costs, and offer better customer-centric services.</p>

    <section class="findings">
        <h2>Findings from White Paper</h2>
        <p>Through a white paper, we analyzed the logistics and operational inefficiencies in e-commerce systems and identified critical areas where optimization could provide substantial improvements. The smart city context further emphasizes the importance of automated and data-driven solutions that adapt to real-time changes in customer behavior, market conditions, and supply chain dynamics.</p>

        <h2>City Design and Business Case Identification</h2>
        <p>The design of the smart city plays a significant role in shaping the business cases identified for this project. Features such as smart traffic management, real-time data collection, and IoT (Internet of Things) systems provide a wealth of information that can be used to optimize e-commerce logistics. By analyzing customer data, traffic patterns, and inventory levels, we can design algorithms to solve specific problems in the e-commerce process.</p>
        <p>Based on this, we have identified several business cases, each focusing on different aspects of e-commerce logistics and customer experience.</p>
