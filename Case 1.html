    <h1>Order Delivery Optimization</h1>
    <p>Optimizing delivery routes and schedules is critical for e-commerce businesses. Algorithms like Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall can help find the shortest paths and optimal routes for deliveries, improving efficiency and reducing costs.</p>
    
    <div class="algorithm">
        <h2>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks in an e-commerce delivery system. It is particularly useful in cases where the graph has non-negative edge weights, such as time or distance between delivery points.</p>
        
        <p>The algorithm works by iteratively selecting the node with the smallest tentative distance, updating the distances to its neighboring nodes, and marking it as "visited." This process continues until all nodes have been visited, ensuring the shortest path is found for each node.</p>
        
        <p>In the context of e-commerce logistics, Dijkstra's Algorithm can be used to efficiently calculate the best routes for delivery trucks, helping optimize delivery schedules, reduce fuel costs, and improve overall customer satisfaction by minimizing delivery times.</p>

    <div class="algorithm">
        <h2>Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h2>
        <p>The Bellman-Ford Algorithm is a graph algorithm used to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph. Unlike Dijkstra's Algorithm, the Bellman-Ford Algorithm can handle graphs with negative weight edges. This makes it particularly useful in real-world applications such as e-commerce logistics, where delivery costs or delays may be negative due to special offers, discounts, or refunds.</p>
        
        <p>In the context of e-commerce delivery, Bellman-Ford is useful when considering scenarios like unexpected traffic delays or route discounts, which could create negative delays or costs. The ability to handle negative weights ensures that the algorithm can model such real-world conditions and optimize delivery routes effectively.</p>

    <div class="algorithm">
        <h2>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</h2>
        <p>The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph. This algorithm is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to calculate the shortest path between every pair of locations in a network, such as a logistics system where all possible delivery routes need to be considered.</p>
        
        <p>In the context of e-commerce logistics, the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm can help optimize delivery routes across multiple locations, providing a global perspective on the shortest possible routes between any two delivery points. This can reduce delivery time, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency, especially in large smart cities with complex road networks.</p>
